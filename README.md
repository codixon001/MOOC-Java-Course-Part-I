# MOOC-Java-Course-Part-I

Hello. This is a GitHub repository where I store completed coding exercises for the 2013 Java Programming Part I MOOC offered by the University of Helsinki. 

Feel free to examine my code. I want this repository to be a demonstration of my course progress.
I will post code starting from Exercise 88 on until I finish Part I.
